Hi! I'm Josh, a recent graduate of the [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I've worked a number of bizarre jobs; crash test dummy for a flying car company; selling tourists to retail outlet centres; selling ingots of precious metal for people wanting extra security. At each job (well, maybe less so in the flying car) I've tried to solve systemic problems using basic software that had to be easy to use.

Amongst my projects, this blog will chronicle problems I encounter in programming, and the solutions I pull together. I hope you'll find the answers StackOverflow didn't have!
