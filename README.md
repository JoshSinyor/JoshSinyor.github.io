## Dependencies

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), courtesy of [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://github.com/matz).

GitHub pages uses Jekyll to translate the contents of this repository into a static website rendered in HTML and CSS. In a sense these are the repository's only true dependencies. However, local build and testing of the repository requires the installation of a local version of Jekyll.

This program's other dependencies are minimal and relate solely to testing. They were chosen for their ubiquity and self-contained nature, so that they could be specified as `require: false` and required only in the `test` environment to reduce their impact on the program's speed. For clarity, all dependencies are explicitly invoked by the `Gemfile`.
